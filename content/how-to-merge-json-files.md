Merging multiple JSON files is a common task for developers, data engineers, and analysts. Whether you’re consolidating data exports, combining API results, or managing complex configurations, knowing how to merge JSON files efficiently can save time and prevent errors.

In this complete guide, we’ll walk you through various ways to merge multiple JSON files—from beginner-friendly online tools to advanced Python and JavaScript scripts. We’ll also cover common use cases, real-world examples, and best practices for handling large or nested JSON structures.

## ✅ Why Merge JSON Files?

Before diving into the methods, here’s why you might want to combine multiple JSON files into one:

- 🧩 **Combine data from different sources** (APIs, logs, tools)
- 📁 **Unify split JSON files** into a single dataset
- ⚙️ **Prepare data** for analysis or migration
- 📦 **Bundle configuration files** or test datasets
- 📊 **Simplify parsing** by reducing file clutter

## 🐍 Method 2: Merge JSON Files Using Python

Python is a powerful language for data processing. Here’s how to merge multiple JSON files in just a few lines.

### 📁 Step-by-Step: Merge JSON Files in Python

```python
import json
import glob

# Load all JSON files in folder
json_files = glob.glob("./data/*.json")
merged_data = []

for file in json_files:
    with open(file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        merged_data.extend(data)  # Assumes each file contains a JSON array

# Save merged file
with open("merged.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(merged_data, f, indent=4)
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Fully automated for many files
- Supports complex logic and validation

### ⚠️ Considerations:

- Assumes consistent structure (e.g., all files are arrays)
- Use **try/except** to catch malformed files

---

## 🌐 Method 3: Merge JSON with JavaScript (for Web Devs)

For frontend or Node.js developers, JavaScript is a natural choice.

### 👨‍💻 Browser Example (Assuming Array of Objects):

```html
<input type="file" multiple id="jsonFiles" />
<script>
  document.getElementById("jsonFiles").addEventListener("change", async (e) => {
    let files = e.target.files;
    let merged = [];

    for (let file of files) {
      let text = await file.text();
      let json = JSON.parse(text);
      merged = merged.concat(json);
    }

    console.log(JSON.stringify(merged, null, 2));
  });
</script>
```

### 🧰 Node.js Version:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const files = ["data1.json", "data2.json"];
let merged = [];

files.forEach((file) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file));
  merged = merged.concat(data);
});

fs.writeFileSync("merged.json", JSON.stringify(merged, null, 2));
```

## 💻 Command-Line Approach (Linux/macOS with jq)

If you’re working on the terminal, **jq** can merge JSON files quickly.

### Merge Array-Based Files:

```bash
jq -s add file1.json file2.json file3.json > merged.json
```

- **-s** = slurp multiple inputs into an array
- **add** merges arrays

### Merge Object-Based Files:

```bash
jq -s 'reduce .[] as $item ({}; . * $item)' file*.json > merged.json
```

---

## 🧠 How to Handle Nested or Inconsistent JSON

Sometimes, not all JSON files follow the same structure.

### Example:

```json
// file1.json
{
  "users": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
  ]
}

// file2.json
{
  "users": [
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
  ]
}
```

### Python Merge Strategy:

```python
merged = {"users": []}

for file in json_files:
    with open(file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        merged["users"].extend(data.get("users", []))
```

Use conditionals and **.get()** to safely merge partial structures.
