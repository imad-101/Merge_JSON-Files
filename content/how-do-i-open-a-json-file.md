## What Is a JSON File? Understanding the Basics 🧠

Before we dive into _how to open JSON files_, let’s first understand what a JSON file actually is. JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, and it’s a lightweight format used to store and exchange data. Think of it as a way to organize information in a structured, readable format that both humans and computers can understand. 🤖 A JSON file typically has a `.json` extension and contains data in key-value pairs, often nested within objects or arrays.

Here’s a simple example of what a JSON file might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

JSON files are widely used in web development, APIs, and data storage because they’re easy to parse and work with. But if you’ve never dealt with one before, you might be unsure of _how to open a JSON file_ or even what tools you need to view or edit it. Don’t worry—we’ll cover all the methods step by step! 🛠️

## Why Would You Need to Open a JSON File? 🤷‍♀️

There are plenty of reasons you might need to know _how to open JSON files_. Maybe you’re a developer working with an API that returns data in JSON format, or perhaps you’ve downloaded a configuration file for a program that’s saved as a `.json` file. Some common scenarios include:

- Viewing or editing data exported from a website or application. 🌐
