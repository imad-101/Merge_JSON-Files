If you've ever worked with data‚Äîwhether you're a developer, tester, or just dabbling in coding‚Äîyou've likely encountered JSON üìã. Short for JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is a lightweight, widely used format for storing and exchanging data. Its readability and compatibility with most programming languages make it a staple in modern development, from APIs to configuration files üåê.

Editing raw JSON in a basic text editor, however, can be a nightmare üò©. A single missing comma or brace can lead to a cascade of errors. That's where a good JSON editor comes in, offering features like syntax highlighting, real-time validation, and visual tree views to save you time and frustration.

For Windows users, finding the right JSON editor can be tricky‚Äîsome tools are bloated, require internet access, or lack essential features. This guide highlights the best free JSON editors for Windows in 2025, each chosen for its performance, features, and user experience. Whether you need a lightweight tool or a robust powerhouse, this list has you covered! üòé

- **Syntax Highlighting üåà**: Color-coded code to easily identify keys, values, brackets, and errors.
- **Real-Time Error Checking üö®**: Immediate feedback on malformed JSON to prevent debugging headaches.
- **Tree and Text View Modes üå≥**: Options for raw code editing or a visual breakdown of data.
