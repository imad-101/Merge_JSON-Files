          <p className="mb-4">
            To ensure optimal results when merging JSON files, keep these best
            practices in mind:
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Maintain Consistent Structure
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Consistency is key. Ensure that all JSON files follow the same
            structural conventions so that merging is seamless and errors are
            minimized.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Backup Your Files
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Always back up your original JSON files before merging. This allows
            you to recover your data if something goes awry during the merge
            process.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Test the Merged File
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Validate the merged file using JSON validators or by integrating it
            into a test environment. This helps ensure that the file functions
            as expected.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Optimize for Readability
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you plan to share the merged file with your team or include it in
            documentation, format it for easy reading. Tools like Prettier can
            help format JSON data.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Version Control
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Use version control systems like Git to track changes. This practice
            not only preserves your data history but also simplifies
            collaboration.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Plan for Error Handling
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Implement error handling strategies to catch and resolve issues that
            may arise from inconsistent formats or duplicate keys. A robust plan
            can save you time and prevent data corruption.
